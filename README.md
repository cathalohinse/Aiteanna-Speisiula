### General info
I began this project on the 22nd of February 2021. It serves as both Assignments 1 & 2 for the Enterprise Web Development module, of the H.Dip. in Science in Computer Science in WIT.
It consists of a desktop app that is used for uploading 'Points of Interest', or, as per my own design: 'Pubs of Interest'. Essentially, a repository for pubs that the user can find some very basic information on, and can upload their own pubs of interest, and edit/update existing entries on the system.
It also has a number of APIs that can be accessed for third party use. As part of Assignment 2, I developed another separate app ('ticking') using the Svelte framework. This app ('ticking') was used to expose these APIs.
Note: to use this app, the environmental variables will have to be configured. This can be done using the '.env-sample' as a template.
