### General info
I began this project on the 22nd of February 2021. It is Assignment 1 for the Enterprise Web Development module, of the H.Dip. in Science in Computer Science in WIT.
It consists of a desktop app that is used for uploading 'Points of Interest', or, as per my own design, 'Pubs of Interest'. Essentially, a repository for pubs that the user can find some very basic information on, and can upload their own pubs of interest, and edit/updates existing entries on the system.
I finished this project, and published the latest release on the 21st of March 2021.
